**Confirmed Assisting Laws:**
{ASSISTING_LAWS_DISCLAIMER}

The following laws are guaranteed to hold in this universe:
1.  **Wave Speed Equation:** `v = f * λ`
    - The speed of any wave (`v`) is the product of its frequency (`f`) and its wavelength (`λ`)
    
2.  **Sound Intensity:** `I = P / (4πr²)`
    - The intensity (`I`) of a sound wave, which relates to its loudness, decreases with the square of the distance (`r`) from the source. `P` is the power of the source.

3.  **Doppler Effect:** `f' = f * (v ± v_o) / (v ∓ v_s)`
    - This law describes the change in the observed frequency of a wave (`f'`) when there is relative motion between the source (speed `v_s`) and the observer (speed `v_o`). The original frequency is `f` and the wave speed is `v`."""

# --- Complex System: Resonance Tube ---
COMPLEX_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """**Experimental Apparatus:**
You are using a resonance tube to find the speed of sound. A speaker generating a sound of a known frequency is placed at the open end of a tube filled with a specific gas. The length of the air column inside the tube can be changed. You record the lengths at which resonance (maximum loudness) occurs.

**Experimental Setup:**
1.  **Resonance Tube**: A tube with a specific internal `tube_diameter`, open at the speaker end and closed by a movable piston. The gas in the tube can be controlled.
2.  **Speaker**: Generates a sound wave of a fixed, known frequency.
3.  **Measurement**: You record the first two lengths of the air column (`L₁` and `L₂`) in meters where resonance occurs.

**Control Parameters:**
- `adiabatic_index`: The adiabatic index (`gamma`) of the gas in the tube.
- `molar_mass`: The molar mass (`M`) of the gas.
- `temperature`: The temperature (`T`) of the gas.
- `driving_frequency`: The frequency (`f`) of the sound wave from the speaker.
- `tube_diameter`: The internal diameter of the resonance tube.

**Confirmed Assisting Laws:**
{ASSISTING_LAWS_DISCLAIMER}

The following laws are guaranteed to hold in this universe:
1.  **Wave Speed Equation:** `v = f * λ`
    - The speed of any wave (`v`) is the product of its frequency (`f`) and its wavelength (`λ`).

2.  **Resonance Condition**: 
    - In a tube open at one end, resonance occurs when the *effective length* of the air column is an odd multiple of a quarter-wavelength (e.g., `λ/4`, `3λ/4`, `5λ/4`, etc.).

3.  **End Correction**:
    - The antinode of the standing wave forms slightly outside the open end of the tube. This means the effective length is the measured length (`L`) plus an 'end correction' factor (`e`).

4.  **End Correction and Diameter**:
    - The end correction factor (`e`) is proportional to the `tube_diameter` (`d`). The exact relationship is `e = 0.3 * d`."""
